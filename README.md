Hello there!

My name is Ivo, i'm a student at Federal Institute of science and tecnology, in the city of Parnaiba, state of Piaui, Brazil.
From now on, i'll be using github more often to post my code, to have a backup of them and to help my colleagues. If you have some tips, advises or just want to exchange ideas, you're more than welcome!
That's it for now, but i promise to keep updating this!
